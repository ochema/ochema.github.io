While viewing the trailer during our previous cinematic connivance we had already gathered in a bunch that which would sum up our experience: *gorgeous shots* with a disappointing story. Had I already decided not to partake in this viewing, alas the local cinema's sneak preview lottery of this month landed on Monos nonetheless. After an introduction by the film enthusiasts organising the preview when they do not operate as ticket dispensers at the entrance, the projector finally kicks in.

We get off to a good start. A black screen radiates the sounds of the youths shuffling around and sporadically kicking a ball with bells and other noisy confectionaries. Here, as in most of the film, sounds are crisp and distinct, unadulterated by music and other sound effects. One hears the wind so high in the mountains while the cold and damp become part of your immediate surroundings. Where music and sound effects have been used, their function was to enhance the dramatic and imminent threat, although they did not fit the tone and could have been left out.

The Messenger arrives by horse to drill the child soldiers and to give further instructions handed down by the unnamed Organisation. Why is the Messenger a dwarf? Is it to mimic the theatre of orchestrated South American guerilla conflict? The ludicrousy of using children in the military? Or to signify the insignificance of the children's ordinary life issues - love, hate, fear, hunger, shrooms - in relation to the brutal conflict they will soon find themselves in? Regardless, I find it bad taste. The overrepresentation of dwarves in cinema, not counting Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, is in line with their condemnation to the circus arena. Their gimmicky inclusion, therefore, brings with it absurdity and insincerity reminiscent of DreamWorks animations.

They are given a cow. "Don't harm it". They kill it. They panic. More die. The group falls apart. *Did not see that coming*. Don't forget about the hostage, by the way, the cow was just a distraction, although I sincerely enjoyed the film until she got the bullet.
