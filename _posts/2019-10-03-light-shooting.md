There he was. Amid the cars in the parking lot on the cusp of his [lotta]. Cement that gained consistency welcomed him with a [neugierig] nod. Avidity pollutes the crop.

There we were. Amid the apple orchards and the herbs on the cusp of [herfst]. Greenery that lost its gait was welcoming us with a [wijs] wink. Unparticipation ema(n)ci(p)ates the crop.  

There they were. Amid the tree trunks tapping to their [tarantella]. Apathy that gained momentum welcomed them with indolent [ignavia]. Slothfulness sterilises the crop.

He. We. They.

No dark. No gun.
No powder. No room.

A light shooting. Cocoon.
