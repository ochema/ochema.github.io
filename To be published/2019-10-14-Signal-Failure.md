"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."
-Proverbs 22:6

In many ways, we are living in truly unique times. Above all things, the great technological leap forward that started chugging along in the industrial revolution has amounted to a capacity for creation and destruction that has never before existed in the hands of man. From the creation of machines that could replace hundreds of workers and farmers at the blink of an eye, to the development of chemicals that would turn soldier’s faces into melting masks of flesh, to the brilliant shimmering of quantum-computer chips that blink with the promise of a cold and great intellect to come.

I could list all the great ‘boons’ that technology has brought us, but those pale in relation to the deathly potential our current path has set us upon, and which I fear will be seen through to its very bloody end. Our development of ever-greater technological potential has allowed us to conquer the world and each other. Now, finally, technology has sprung its trap and is well on its way to conquer us in turn.

The most dangerous development of all has been that on how it has shaped and continues to shape our individual experiences and in turn, the framework on which our societies are built. More specifically, there are those that understand this very well and use it to their advantage. In a wholly material age, everything is reduced to mere material and information, to be exchanged, rewritten, or deleted at will. This occurs both in the increasingly dominant digital sphere (think of increasing surveillance and censorship) as well as in the physical, where nations and people are on a seemingly ‘unstoppable’ trajectory towards melding into a single globalised, sickly organism, firmly bent to the new gods of the marketplace and glass-fibre cabling.

What can we call as world in such a state? As we near the event horizon of complete racial and social collapse, we may be speak of the this age the Kali Yuga. This is the Age of Kali, Goddess of Death & Time, who heralds a time of unmaking and ethe darkest night before the dawn. We may speak of Deadworld (David Wong, John Dies at the End), a domain in which all has become hollowed out and most people have become husks unaware of the shadowpeople at the levers, automatons just getting by. Paul Waggener of Operation Werewolf has also termed it the Empire of Nothing. Clownworld and Absurdistan are also cousins to this typology of an experience of the world so totally hollowed out, so totally ruled by those without a shred of a soul, and so totally set on immersing our brains, bodies and blood in its acid broth forever.

We conquered the world. We built ever faster vehicles, from great sailor fleets setting out to seek the edge of the world to the soaring jet planes defying gravity. Distance has ceased to exist, and there are no more physical frontiers left but the bottom of the ocean. Naturally, this building of ever finer machinery was only possible through the ongoing accumulation and development of knowledge. We built great universities, libraries, and the finest heads of our peoples labored ceaselessly to unlock the next secret of the universe. Today, millions of peer-reviewed papers are churned out every year, and every second we see an expert give his or her qualified opinion on a topic that those who control media and minds would like you to buy into, lubricated by the weight of their authority. Our world has been shrunk to the size of a pin where all information and peoples must converge – faulty opinions deviating from this may simply be written out of existence.

But let us take a look at one mechanism that in fact enables this entire Deadworld structure to persist and expand so easily. Like many others, I believe that the end of and period following World War 2 heralded a spiritual deathblow to our people, causing us to devote all our energies only to the development of technology (becoming servants in our hunt for mastery), ‘gifting’ this technology to the rest of the world, and then retreating once again to our homelands to curl up and wait for the end as the world tore apart at the seams and slowly turned its febrile eyes back towards us, the Tätervolk.  

More to the point, what truly constitutes one of the pillars (if not the foundation) of a healthy society and Volk? It is the health of its family and kinship ties. Perhaps the most fundamental aspect here is the eternal transmission of knowledge, values and life experience from one generation to the next, from father to son and from mother to daughter. In this aspect, we can see the eternal chain of life, unbroken and continued. And this is transmission is what was severed after World War 2, leading to an increasing chasm between generations as each generation separated itself further from both its more distant ancestors as well as its direct forebears and offspring. Boomers, Babyboomers, Millennials, Gen XYZ… All both experiencing two sides of this coin as each generation simply becomes envious and disdainful of the next while naturally around them, a myriad of other factors rip apart the social fabric at the seams through cultural alienation,  the destruction of the last vestiges of ‘honest work’, and the rampant advocacy and normalisation of every type of degenerate behavior.

What we see now is that parents, and in my experience especially fathers, are no longer able to fully commit themselves to that role. Not just of ‘giver of life and money’ that stands at the beginning of one’s life, but also the very skills, attitudes and lessons hard-learned themselves that will provide their offspring with a lasting guidance instead of leaving them to constantly pick up their own pieces in a world more frayed of meaning and guidance than ever. And who can blame them?

**The first severing:**

In World War 1, a generation of our great-great-grandfathers perished. Those that came back were scarred, shellshocked, but held on to the illusion of having done their duty in this first of the great brother-wars. Many too young to fight will have lost fathers, and those fathers that returned could not ever fully come to grips again with the normal world after being thrown in world of blood, iron and grime that war means.

**The second severing:**

In World War 2, we again see the same repeating. Fathers go to war together with their sons, and only of them returns. Entire families are eradicated or half-eradicated through aerial fire-bombings, death-marches, prison and labor camps. The lucky ones start their life again among the bombed out ruins of their nations, now slowly being filled with foreign faces to fill in the gaps. They start a family, yet who is there to guide them in how to build it to strong foundations? A generation of boys forced to become men, and returning to a society too shell-shocked to admit it and being filled in with the spiritual cement of modernity. Which rituals would they continue in their families, or would they just try to emulate that ideal nuclear family until it too slowly dissolved?

**The third severing:**

The sons of the soldiers, growing up too with distant fathers and often without grandfathers. Their fathers rather showed a stiff upper lip or shrugged with their shoulders, unsure of how to help their sons grow into fully formed men through for instance teaching them humility, patience, control without overbearance, the importance of a healthy nature; they found it hard to become conscious of their role, how to listen and guide sons that always, always are angry at the world with energy that needs to be directed.

They work too much – the last generation for whom it still pays off. Their female counterparts have naturally done the same, and across the board marriage is delayed, ending in perhaps 2 children and a divorce in 50% of the cases. The entire ecosystem of the family is now fully reaching the treshhold, and while this generation is still able to prosper within the techno-severed world, it too fails to understand or meaningfully interact with their own children for they have become ‘individuals’ locked out of a wider social context. They see their parents grow old and die, and gradually with them, not only the once-extended network of family and friends that these still possessed, but also much pain and knowledge never truly expressed.

**The fourth severing?**

By now, a new generation of men has entered an age where they too will perhaps enter fatherhood soon. A generation that has even more than the past been left to ‘reinvent the wheel’ when it comes to dealing with the myriad of pitfalls and hurdles in their way. Perhaps they can expect little from their own fathers in the first place – their world is entirely alien in many ways to anything that previous generations would have encountered. Totally atomised societies, flex-work, the perpetual quotas of gender and race, and ceaseless attacks from all corners on healthy traditions pertaining to gender, sexuality, identity; the escape of idle consumerism on the one hand and the Damocles sword of climate-apocalypticism on the other.

Yet for precisely such a world, the ability to look back and use the eternal values passed on by previous generations to guide oneself through the madness is truly key. Young men in the Western world have become obsolete, as all roles they once filled have been designated mere racist and / or sexist social constructs, and all past points of pride and longing to build on & for something have been carefully pruned and castrated. On advertisements, a white smile set in a dark face gleams at him, the owner’s hands around his white and female counterpart’s waist. An advertisement or an announcement? The young man is expected to accept, avert his gaze, and ideally buy the product.

What victories and aspirations could such a young man still shape for himself, those that have not been served to him on a diet-sized dinner plate by others? To such a man, severed from traditions, anything can now be sold. He has no time for family – he is too busy exploring the shallow marketplace of meat offered by dating apps or pleasuring himself to filth once even that hysterial mating-ritual has become too stressful or dangerous for him – in the long term, replacing any motivation for love and family (though not the deeply felt need) through chemical rewiring of the brain. He has access to everything, and nothing. He has accepted that the only opinion he may hold that may 'matter' is how much power he allows foreigners and women to take from the limp hands of his Deadworld society. Love, knowledge, history – he relies on others for all of these things, to fill the gaping void left by generations of physical and spiritual warfare. What sons, if any, would such a man raise?
How must sons be raised in our times that they may claim their heritage, and forge their path in this swamp of modernity?
