Ochema is a vehicle. It transports man across his intercosmic journey, from the sublunary world to the higher spheres. The vehicle carries him, protects him, is affected by his decisions, thickens when he acts irrationally, thins when he operates rationally, sheds when the soul is ready to set free from his earthly fetters.

Ochema is a charioteer. A transparent pneumatic envelope attached to the body without participating in it. It flies and is imposed by the presence of the daimon within the soul. It protects this from the illusions and sinful temptations of reality.

Ochema is a body-not-a-body. A quasi-real presence in a world of absence. An immaterial corpuscule that escapes the senses by infiltrating the mind.

Ochema re-views man’s continuous attempt at being in a world of becoming.
