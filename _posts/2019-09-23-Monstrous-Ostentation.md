While viewing the trailer during our previous cinematic connivance we had already gathered in a bunch that which would sum up our experience: *gorgeous shots* with a disappointing story. Had I already decided not to partake in this viewing, alas the local cinema's sneak preview lottery of this month landed on Monos nonetheless. After an introduction by the film enthusiasts organising the preview when they do not operate as ticket dispensers at the entrance, the projector finally kicks in.

We get off to a good start. A black screen radiates the sounds of the youths shuffling around and sporadically kicking a ball with bells and other noisy confectionaries. Here, as in most of the film, sounds are crisp and distinct, unadulterated by music and other sound effects. One hears the wind so high in the mountains while the cold and damp become part of your immediate surroundings. Where music and sound effects have been used, their function was to enhance the dramatic and imminent threat, although they did not fit the tone and could have been left out.

The Messenger arrives by horse to drill the child soldiers and to give further instructions handed down by the unnamed La Organización (FARC?). Why is the Messenger a dwarf? Is it to mimic the theatre of orchestrated South American guerilla conflict? The ludicrousy of using children in the military? Or to signify the insignificance of the children's ordinary life issues - love, hate, fear, hunger, shrooms - in relation to the brutal conflict they will soon find themselves in? Regardless, I find it bad taste. The overrepresentation of dwarves in cinema, not counting Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, is in line with their condemnation to the circus arena. Their gimmicky inclusion, therefore, brings with it absurdity and insincerity reminiscent of DreamWorks animations.

They are given a cow. "Don't harm it". They kill it. They panic. More die. The group falls apart. *Did not see that coming*. Don't forget there is the hostage, by the way, the cow was just a distraction, although I sincerely enjoyed the film until she got the bullet... With new coordinates, the group embarks down the mountains into the jungle, only to further disintegrate. Power hungry children now hunt each other as much as they hunt the continuously escaping prisoner, an international journalist. The single youth sceptical from the start, known by the name Rambo, escapes the group, too, and finds his way to a family home alongside the river. He enters a timeless, wholesome life, contrasting a traumatised child, plunged back into the normality of watching game shows on television and playing chase in the backyard, with midnight jungle attacks executed by the remaining squad of child soldiers against La Organización. The prisoner is rescued after a grand escape, so we are told by the television in the family home. The family itself did not survive the search for Rambo, however, but Rambo eventually manages to outrun the group and is rescued by a helicopter too.

Rambo and the hostage, also dubbed *La doctora*, stood out for this reason. In hindsight, they may even have been the two characters one can identify with the most. Rambo as the innocent child, unwilling to take part in the maltreatment of the hostage. The remorseless *doctora*, on the other hand, acts as an observer and receiver of the plot. Like the viewer, she is carried along by the child soldiers wherever they have to go.

Have I already mentioned the group's "signature", an annoying sound made by kissing the palm of their hands? Perhaps intended as daunting and intimidating, it felt above all like a forced, gimmicky motif.
