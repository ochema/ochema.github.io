Upon hearing the name Bel Air, the mind of most or some depending on their age, harks back to the sunny hillsides of Los Angeles, where the fresh prince Will Smith lit up the landscape through his smiley street-smart escapades in the Nineties. In the continental Bel Air, the sun only pierces through the thick cloud bank wrapping the suburbia when forceful winds cast off the patches of pollution coating the city of Colmar. In a remote area of the High-Rhyne region in France, the air smells like asphaltic apathy.

In an anonymous concrete condominium live equally anonymous individuals, each one escaping from the world in their own way. Eventually couples of them are brought together by the course of the events. The actress and the teenager. The astronaut and the housewife. The nurse and the broken man. They interact but never act. At a closer inspection, they act throughout.

The actress is living a moment of transition and lives temporarily in a small flat in the condominium, waiting to make her definitive move elsewhere. She lives on the same floor of a teenager supposedly living with his mother, whom we never see. The two share a love of cinema and of themselves. They meet in the evening to watch the actress’ past black-and-white films on a small television screen. Two generations apart, equally inward-looking and feeding on two equally misleading myths: eternal youth and fame.

The astronaut lands on the roof of the condominium with his parachute, diverted because of technical issues. He is hosted by an Arabic-speaking housewife, living alone because her son is imprisoned. She takes good care of him, cooks couscous and liaises with the NASA officers calling the astronaut to arrange his retrieval. Two worlds apart, equally outward-looking and feeding on two equally endearing desires: being motherly and floating in a womb.

The broken man lives on the first floor of the condominium. He refuses to pay for the new lift being installed and he is therefore denied the right to make use of it by the neighbours. Karma strikes. He has an accident and ends up in a wheelchair, so recurs to the lift even if he should not. To avoid being caught, he lives the flat to go on a hunt for food in the middle of the night, when nobody can see him. Everything is closed in deserted Bel Air. Only a vending machine in the local hospital provides him with something to snack on. He inserts some coins to purchase a croissant, but it gets stuck in the machine. He is desperate. He is about to leave the building when he sees a blond woman smoking outside. She is a nurse on her break from the night shift. They start talking and he pretends to be what he is not: a National Geographic photographer. He lies because he wants to impress her. She is easily fooled, she believes him. She wants to see some of his pictures. He cannot fail her, so once at home, he turns the tv on and starts taking snaps of the screen with her dead mother’s camera, capturing pink skies and wild fauna in remote lands he has never even heard of. He shows the pictures to the nurse, who does not seem too impressed. Two blocks apart, equally scared of their own shadow, latching on two equally frightful fears: that of love and that of life.

Embraced by asphalt, the actress, the teenager, the astronaut, the housewife, the broken man and the nurse inhale concrete and exhale abstractions. They walk through life as if dead. They become alert upon hearing a mysterious sound of which they ignore the origin. It comes from the rusty door of a building site container nearby. They do not know that. They will never know that because they would never dare to set foot out of their house. They are the condominium of broken hearts, barely living, living barely. The dystopian distortion of a soulless society. No sun, no smiles, no shimmery skies. Bel Air inflated by the apathy of an eerie existence. Macadam stories.
