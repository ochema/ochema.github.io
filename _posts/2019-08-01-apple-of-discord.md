The Greek goddess Eris and her Roman counterpart Discordia would have jubilated in front of the vitrines of patisserie Slijcers. A fly hovering above a stilted slice of days-old apple cake while condensation colonised the glass case with water crystals. Much is up for debate right there. Yet, in silence, we order precisely that slice of cake, maybe to test our chances for survival, maybe to inject some of the animal’s anima in our own. We sit. The cakes are delivered together with a selection of high teas geometrically disposed on a white rectangle of porcelain. We pause. We eat. The first impression is that of a weird mixture of textures, an unblended agglomerate of apple compote and undercooked apple slices glued together by a thick gluey dough of sickly sweetness. Stoically, we endure the torture because we know that coherence rules out criticism. It makes revenge sweeter, in case the cake was not sweet enough on its own.

The tart’s aftertaste is a mix of disappointment and thrill. The feeling of disapproval towards an edible item among our favourites of such poor quality fights against the light in our eyes once we lift them from the plate and we unleash the critics within us. Fiery, fierce, flashing critics pour out of our mellowed tongues, then washed away by gushes of lukewarm ginger tea. The simple question is: “Why is it so difficult to eat a proper apple cake nowadays, wherever you are in the world?”. The complex question is: “Does the human mind veer towards negligence purposefully or is the general tendency to cobble things together the result of some deeper refusal of order?”. In case a straightforward answer is impossible, this would be the alternative conundrum: “How can contemporary culinary catastrophes be connected to the frantical gait at which life moves and moulds?”.
