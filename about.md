The Ochema Review. Cultural Anatomy Charioteers.

The Ochema Review is a platform for cultural anatomy charioteers, who carry out cultural dissections with rationality and passion.

Ochema reviewers lay bare the most billowing body of knowledge. They categorise all its parts and feed the mind of others with their savantly synthesised substance. It is the ethic of the charioteers to work for the benefit of others. To this end, they discover, decipher, distil and deliver meaningful messages for the spine, the spleen, the ears, the eyes, the buds and the bronchi. To each part its own appropriate content. All by way of sympathy.

Ochema is a vehicle. It transports man across his intercosmic journey, from the sublunary world to the higher spheres. The vehicle carries him, protects him, is affected by his decisions, thickens when he acts irrationally, thins when he operates rationally, sheds when the soul is ready to set free from its earthly fetters.

Ochema is a charioteer. A transparent pneumatic envelope attached to the body without participating in it. It flies and is imposed by the presence of the daimon within the soul. It protects this from the illusions and sinful temptations of reality.

Ochema is a body-not-a-body. A quasi-real presence in a world of absence. An immaterial corpuscule that escapes the senses by infiltrating the mind.

Ochema re-views man’s continuous attempt at being in a world of becoming.
