The new exhibition presented by the Leeuwarden Ceramic Museum, Sunken Treasures, showcases the contents found aboard eight shipwrecks dating from the ninth to the nineteenth centuries, recuperated in the waters of the Far East, the West coast of Africa and the Pacific. Vases, jars, utensils, plates, pots, foods, figurines, mirrors and mugs are showcased in glass vetrines that emphasise their preciousness and elevate them from relics to rarities. Most of the treasures are preserved intact, each demonstrating that if reduced to its material dimension, the history of art is not only incomplete, but wrong altogether. An oval blue and white jar of medium dimensions, for instance, might seem a simple decorative object, but is, in fact, a medicine dispenser whose contents might have saved a person’s life. The thin strips of metal bordering a rusty mug might seem mere decorations, but are actually straws with which men drank wine through their noses seven hundred years ago. These objects demand attention. They ask the viewer to be read as texts in context. They prove that art is about more than just things and primarily about thoughts. The history of such art, therefore, ought to contemplate more than mere manufacts and extend as far as the minds that manipulated matter into those same facts.  

Sunken Treasures does exactly this: it leaps from the status of the art to its significance. In so doing, the vases, jars, utensils, plates, pots, foods, figurines, mirrors and mugs that we initially saw as vestiges become vivid valuables. What is more, the exhibition turns objects into indexes: of a lived life, of a commercial transaction, of a sea tragedy, of a cultural exchange, of a solitary meal, of a private prayer. Every piece has the ability to transport us to the upper deck of a ship the moment before it sunk. There, we peruse without being seen, the gestures and gaits of men, who braved death and challenged the sea; sometimes moved by the simple desire to know, mostly on the lookout for money. A Japanese merchant scrapes our arm with his belt, the remains of which are now in room one. A Chinese immigrant sits in a corner trying not to be seen; he is leaving his country illegally, praying his small porcelain god to protect him. The god survives in room four, he succumbed to the law of the sea. Our gaze explores further and finds an Arabic trader, passing his finger across the small lacquered plate he just acquired from the Japanese merchant, who walked past us a while ago. The quality control is interrupted by an unexpected jolt. Ambition, fear, hope and suspicion all sink, only to be resuscitated by the tide of archeological curiosity centuries after their decay.  

Suddenly, we are sitting in a New York room brimming with impatient men and women waving red palettes with numbers on them. In the middle of an auction we recognise the belt, the porcelain god and the lacquered plate, now magnified on a screen with their prize beside them. We blink incredulous. We are back in Leeuwarden. Those objects are in front of our eyes, more real than on a screen, less intact than on the ship we visited with our imagination. This is when you know that the exhibition you are visiting is unique: because it makes you wonder about your place in the world. And it does so through the fragments of ordinary objects.

Sunken Treasures breaks free from the constraints of circumstance precisely because it does not force the past to speak to the present. It simply makes us think through objects without turning these into simulacra or devotional relics. It demonstrates that the extra-ordinary is to be found in the ordinary.
