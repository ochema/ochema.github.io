Ochema is a vehicle. It transports man across his intercosmic journey, from the sublunary<br>world to the higher spheres. The vehicle carries him, protects him, is affected by his<br>decisions, thickens when he acts irrationally, thins when he operates rationally,<br>sheds when the soul is ready to set free from his earthly fetters.
<br><br>
Ochema is a charioteer. A transparent pneumatic envelope attached to the body<br>without participating in it. It flies and is imposed by the presence of the daimon<br>within the soul. It protects this from the illusions and sinful temptations of reality.
<br><br>
Ochema is a body-not-a-body. A quasi-real presence in a world of absence.<br>An immaterial corpuscule that escapes the senses by infiltrating the mind.
<br><br>
Ochema re-views manâ€™s continuous attempt at being in a world of becoming.
